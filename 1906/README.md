==========

Since we have an array of experience levels, lets start off with a couple scenarios that are a bit simpler. We'll see how these go and discuss how much more difficult we should get.

I'm going to write the examples (and my solution) in JavaScript, but you're welcome to use any language you'd like. (But, realistically, let's say JS or Ruby, since that's primarily what we're using at Ample.)

Problems
----------

### Problem 1: Filtering Numbers

Given an array of non-zero positive numbers and/or strings, return an array consisting only of the integers from the original array in their original order.

**Function:**

```js
function filterList(l) {
  // ...
}
```

**Test cases:**

```js
filterList([1, 2, 'a', 'b'])
// => [1, 2]

filterList([1, 'a', 'b', 0, 15])
// => [1, 0, 15]

filterList([1, 2, 'aasf', '1', '123', 123])
// => [1, 2, 123]
```

### Problem 2: Duplicate Characters

Given a string of characters, return a string, where the character ( represents characters occurring only once from the original string, and ) represents characters occurring more than once. The result should be case insensitive, meaning upper and lower case letters of the same letter are considered the same character.

For example, din should return (((, while Success should return )())()).

**Function:**

```js
function duplicateEncode(word) {
  // ...
}
```

**Test Cases:**

```js
duplicateEncode("din")
// => "((("

duplicateEncode("recede")
// => "()()()"

duplicateEncode("Success")
// => ")())())"

duplicateEncode("(( @")
// => "))(("
```

Submitting Solutions
----------

Your solution should be placed in the `solutions` directory, in the file named after you. You'll notice each function gets exported from the file. That's what we want for testing â€” don't change any of the boilerplate (you can delete comments).

To run the tests, first change into this directory and install dependencies.

    $ cd 1906
    $ npm install

Add your name to the array of test cases for the solution you want to test in `test-cases.js`. Then you can run the test suite:

    $ npm test

Once your solutions are passing, open a pull request with your changes, using the format: _[1906]: Name_.
