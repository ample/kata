Ample Kata
==========

The projects within this repo represent the kata exercises that Ample uses to open each month's dev code share meeting.

Each project is designated in date format as YYMM.

Please see the individual projects for instructions on the problems and how to test or submit solutions.

If there is something you'd like to contribute to the overall code base, you may submit that as a PR to this repo at any time.
